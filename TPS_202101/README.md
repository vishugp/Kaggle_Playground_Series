Description
Kaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions, and thus more beginner-friendly.

In order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching a month-long tabular Playground competition on the 1st of every month, and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation.

The goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, but less challenging, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.

For each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.

Good luck and have fun!

Getting Started
Check out this Starter Notebook which walks you through how to make your very first submission!

For more ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.

Evaluation
Submissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:

RMSE=1n∑i=1n(yi−y^i)2−−−−−−−−−−−−√
where y^
 is the predicted value, y
 is the original value, and n
 is the number of rows in the test data.

Submission File
For each row in the test set, you must predict the value of the target as described on the data tab, each on a separate row in the submission file. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,target
0,0.5
2,10.2
6,2.2
etc.
